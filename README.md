#SUMMARY
To determine the "hot spots" of the application, I used VisualVM to find out which methods consumed more percentage of time when software run. I set the argument to be 15. And set a pattern for subsequent test in advance. It could make sure that the test pattern is same everytime. That could be used for manual test and easily analyze the change when I modified code in order to improve the performance. Therefore, from the profiling consequence of CPU, I found the convertToInt(),backup() and runContinuous() in MainPanel.java have low performances. And the toString() in Cell.java too. Because when the program complete the whole progress to acquire the stable solution for pre-load pattern, the percentage of self time of those are much higher then others except toString().
